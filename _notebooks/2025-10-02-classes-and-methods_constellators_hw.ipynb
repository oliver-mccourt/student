    "\n",
    "1) Create a class Person with properties 'name' and 'age'. Print their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Add a method greet() to your Person class that prints a greeting using the person's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Create a class Book with properties 'title', 'author', and 'pages'. Instantiate a book and print its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Add a method read(pages) to your Book class that increments a pagesRead property and prints a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Add a method isLongBook() that returns true if pages > 300, otherwise false. Print the result for your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Create a class Car with properties 'make', 'model', and 'fuel'. Add methods drive(distance) and refuel(amount). Print messages in each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Add a static method info() to your Car class that prints 'Cars are vehicles.'\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Create a class ElectricCar that extends Car. Add a property 'battery' and a method charge(amount) that increases battery. Print battery level after charging.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Create a routine that combines your objects: drive a Car, charge an ElectricCar, read pages from a Book, and call greet() on Person. Print outputs for each action.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) **Extra Credit:** Submit the original OOP Breakout Game Code (found on [OpenCS](https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/pages/blob/main/hacks/breakout/breakout.md?plain=1)) after making the following edits:\n",
    "- Add another feature to the game: Add a method so that the ball must collide with some bricks twice for a brick to break completely.\n",
    "- Edit a method in the ball class to increase/decrease the speed of the ball: Please add a COMMENT on the game code that specifies which line you edited."
